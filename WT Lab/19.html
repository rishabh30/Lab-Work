            <div class="hide">Mahendra Singh Dhoni (About this sound pronunciation ;
                commonly known as M. S. Dhoni; born 7 July 1981) is an Indian cricketer and
                the current captain of the Indian national cricket team in limited-overs formats.
                An attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded
                as one of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made his
                One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his
                first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.

                An explosive left-handed opening batsman, Warner is the first
